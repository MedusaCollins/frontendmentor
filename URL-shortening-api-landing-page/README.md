### Project Inspiration

This project was inspired by an Udemy course that taught how to create a project from scratch using a public API. While the design concept was obtained from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/) to help make a decision about the project's visual design, all the code has been written entirely by me.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser): Node.js body parsing middleware.
- [ejs](https://github.com/mde/ejs): Embedded JavaScript templates for Node.js.
- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
